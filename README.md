# Log Classification With Hybrid Classification Framework

This project implements a hybrid log classification system, combining three complementary approaches to handle varying levels of complexity in log patterns. The classification methods ensure flexibility and effectiveness in processing predictable, complex, and poorly-labeled data patterns.

## Classification Approaches

1. **Regular Expression (Regex)**:
   - Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
   - Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.

2. **Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression**:
   - Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
   - Utilizes embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers and applies Logistic Regression as the classification layer.

3. **LLM (Large Language Models)**:
   - Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available.
   - Provides a fallback or complementary approach to the other methods.
